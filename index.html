    <h2>My Projects</h2>
    
        <p> This is a project I worked on recently. It is a website for a local business. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the site. I also used Bootstrap to make it responsive. I am really proud of how it turned out and I learned a lot while working on it.</p>
        <p> This is another project I worked on recently. It is a web application that allows users to search for recipes based on the ingredients they have on hand. I used React to build the front end and Node.js to build the back end. I also used MongoDB to store the recipe data. It was a challenging project but I learned a lot while working on it.</p>
